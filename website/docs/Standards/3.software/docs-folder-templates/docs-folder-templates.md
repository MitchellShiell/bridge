# `/docs`

The following pages describe the minimum standard of developer documentation required within the `/docs` folder of an Overture project:

    ```
    .
    └── /docs/
        ├── /overview/
        │   └── overview.md
        ├── setup.md
        ├── development.md
        ├── deployment.md
        └── glossary.md
    ```


Templates for these files are linked and can be found on their respective pages. 

1. **Overview:** Either a single technical overview page or a folder containing multiple organized pages.

2. **Setup:** How to set up the development environment.

3. **Development:** Either a single page or folder of related pages describing common practices and processes for working with the project's codebase.

4. **Deployment:** Guidelines and best practices for deployments to differing environments.

5. **Glossary of terms:** List of project specific terms with definitions.

All files should be written in markdown and stored in the `/docs` folder of the project repository.
