# `ReadMe.md`

All Overture repositories have a `README.md` file stored in the root directory of the project. This standardized README template serves several important purposes:

1. **Project Overview**: The README provides a high-level summary of what the project does, its relationship to the broader Overture platform, and any relevant software components or related projects.

2. **Getting Started**: It includes instructions for setting up the project locally, accessing documentation, and getting support or making contributions.

3. **Documentation**: The README links to more detailed developer docs, product docs, and platform guides to help users understand how to work with and configure the software.

4. **Community Engagement**: It encourages users to get involved by reporting issues, making contributions, and connecting on the Overture Slack channel.

By providing this consistent README template across all Overture repositories, the project aims to make it easier for both new and experienced users to quickly understand the purpose, setup, and resources available for each component. This helps foster a more accessible and collaborative open-source community.
