# Getting Started

Welcome to the Overture developer documentation. Here you will find comprehensive information on using our software microservices in a development context. Whether you're new to Overture or an experienced developer, this documentation will guide you through setup, usage, and best practices for our various services.

## Core Software Structure

Our core software documentation is organized to provide you with a clear and logical path through each service:

```
.
└── /Service/
    ├── /Overview
    ├── /Setup
    └── /Usage
```

### Overview

The Overview section for each service typically includes:
    - High-level overview of the service
    - System architecture diagram and explanation
    - Key features and capabilities
    - Repository structure
    - Links to relevant GitHub repositories or additional resources

### Setup 

The Setup section runs you through the process of getting each service setup in a development environment. We offer guidance for the following Overture development configurations:

## Under Development

Here we provide an overview of software currently under development and soon to be integrated into the Overture platform. 

- We are currently working on a new data submission system to better
support tabular (clinical) data. This new system will see two new components integrated into the Overture Platform:

   - [**Lectern**](/docs/under-development/lectern/): A Data Dictionary Schema Manager, providing a system for defining Schemas that will validate the structured data collected by an application. 
   - [**Lyric**](/docs/under-development/lyric/): Validate, store, query, and re-validate tabular data against evolving Lectern Dictionary schemas.

- Additionally, we are updating our Indexing service Maestro to be compatible with our new submission system:

   - [**Maestro v2**](/): Index Song file metadata and Lyric tabular data into one elasticsearch index.
