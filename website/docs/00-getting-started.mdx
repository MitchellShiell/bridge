# Getting Started

Welcome to the Overture developer documentation. Here you will find comprehensive information on using our software microservices in a development context. Whether you're new to Overture or an experienced developer, this documentation will guide you through setup, usage, and best practices for our various services.

## Core Software Structure

Our core software documentation is organized to provide you with a clear and logical path through each service:

```

```

### Overview

The Overview section for each service typically includes:
    - High-level overview of the service
    - System architecture diagram and explanation
    - Key features and capabilities
    - Repository structure
    - Links to relevant GitHub repositories or additional resources
