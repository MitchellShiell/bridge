# RESTful APIs

import SwaggerAPIDoc from '/src/components/SwaggerAPIDoc';

All our available RESTful APIs use Swagger to help document endpoint usage and expected outcomes. Here are some tips for using the Swagger UI:

1. **Expand Operations**: Click on an endpoint to expand its details.
2. **Read Descriptions**: Each endpoint has a description explaining its purpose and usage.
3. **Check Parameters**: Review the required and optional parameters for each endpoint.
4. **Examine Responses**: Look at the possible response codes and schemas to understand what to expect from each endpoint.
